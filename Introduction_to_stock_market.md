### Technical Analysis
#### Candlestick patterns

There imp rules - 
- Buy strength (bearish market since last days and buy at bullish at strength) and sell at weakness
- Be flexible with patterns (verify and quantify)
- Look for prior trend

##### Single Candlestick patterns
The pattern formed by one candle

**The candle range** - the length of the candle higher in general specifies more buying / selling activity.
Normal formula high-low
Formula to - (Clos-open)/ ((open+low)/2)
Too short(less trade, unfavorable) - 0.75% and Too long(stoploss is long) - 10% range (both not good for trade)
*Trades on very short candle should be avoided*
**Risk taker would trade on the same day after spotting pattern at 3:20pm while rish averse wait for 2nd day to check for green candle**
- **Marubozu** - Word means round part. 
  Tere are two types - Bullish and bearish Marubuzo.
  Maribozu is the only rule which violates 3rd rule.
  What is it - Round candlestick means there is no shadow means open=low and high=close implies bullish marubozu and 
  reverse for bearish.
  Means people wanted to buy at every price point for bullish marubozu.
  **As due to vast demand the surge of bullish sentiment will be for more trading sessions so buying opportunity is sure**
  _In Reality Open can be close to low as minor variation is accepted_
  **Normally buy at stoploss = open for the bullish day**
- **Spinning Top** - The body is small and shadow is of same length. This means bulls tried to make market grow but didnt suceed and so did bearers both failed. It conveys indecision as both were not able to influence. 

- **Doji** - When open and close are equal means no real body, only shadow is present. It represents indecision so *be prepared to expect market to go low or high and plan accordingly*

- **Paper Umbrella** - its single sided spinning top then it conveys strong evidence of bulls or bears trying to impact market. Hanging   man means bearish and appearing after uptend rally and Hammer means bullish and appearing after downward rally.
  To qualify as paper umbrella, shadow should be **atleast twice than body** matters most.Bullish hammer means after downward trend bulls finally break the prices and were succesful, means signs of upward trend. _Editor note hammer more trusted than hanging man_
  
- **Shooting Star** - It is like inverted paper umbrella, it is a bearish pattern appears after bullish rally
  
#### Multiple Candlestick

- **Englufing** - It has 2 trading session, one being small and T2 being relatively long.
  - Bullish Engulfing - Three rules 
    - It should be after a down trend or rally.
    - T1 candlestick should be red.
    - T2 should be green and long enough to engulf the red candle.
    
  - Bearish Engulfing - Three Rules
    - It should be after upward rally
    - T1 should be greeen.
    - T2 should be red and should engulf the T1 candlestick.
  **Combining Engulfing and doji - If on P1 and P2 follows engulfing and on next day there is doji means a great sign of trading, its an     never miss opportunity whenever doji is followed by a recognizable pattern.**
- **Piercing** - Same as bullish engulfing but engulfing is one sided means partial and range of P2= More than 50% and less than 100 of   P1.
- **Dark cloud** - Same as bearish engulfing with minor variation which is half bearish engulf same as piercing, trade set up is same.
**Stocks of same sector like TCS and Infosys move in similar way, as if -ve news for banking then banking stocks all will fall and have similar candlestick patterns mostly**
- **Harami** - Two candlesticks, P1 is long and P2 is small and both generallly are opposite colors, P1 engulfs P2.
  - **Bullish** - P1 is red and P2 is green and is followed by down trend.
  - **Bearish** - After upward trend, P1 is green and long and P2 is small engulfed by P1, sign to short on stock.
  
Note - **Price Gap concept** - Price Gap up When stock closes and opens on other day at different price.Means buys were happy to buy at more price than closed yesterday means the news shown is positive on stock. Similarly, price gap down opens at lesser than close previously.

- **Morning Star** - 3 candlestick pattern. It is after down trend. P1 is red candle, P2 has gap down opening and forming doji/spinning top means indecision in market. P2 gap up opening and green candle with closing above P1s opening hence, compensating the loss at once, the stocks are likely to go high and long trade sign is there.

#### Target price Calculate Using S&R
**S is support** - Its when buyers more than seller. It is below current market price.Hence if you wanna short a trade target price will be support. 
**R is Resistance** - when sellers are more.It is the position with abundance of stocks for buyers.Hence, more selling means prices will
                      will go down after reaching high. It is above current market price.If you wanna long then target price is resistance level.
                     
**The S&R line could be support or resistance depending on current market price**
**Steps to construct** - 
- If Long term trader then take 12-18 months of data else 3-6 months.
- Identify these points on data
  - The price hesitating to move up after a long up movement.
  - The price hesitating to move down after brief down movement.
  - The sharp reversal at particular price points.
  
 - The points should be after proper time gap, should not be too close, atleast 2 weeks gap for 3-6 months.
 
 **Note** - It is not gaurantee that S&R line would work but a well constructed one are respected.
 
 **Volume** - If 100 shares are bought and 100 sold then volume is 100 not 200.
 
 **Chart for Volume with price for pattern evaluation**
 Price    Volume    Pattern
 Increase Increase  Bullish
 Increase Decrease  Weak hand buying
 Decrease Increase  Bearish
 Decrease Decrease  Weak selling
 _Volume on today is compared with last 10 days as reference, calculate by moving average_
 
**Institutional Money** Big institutions like LIC buy large chunk for shares which  can make wise moves in market and its called smart money comapred to retail trader. Hence when price and volume both increase means big player is showing interest, hence means bullish trend and buy sign. ALso, buy whenver volumes are huge means you are buyig with smart money.

When price increase and volume doesn't means no instituional participant is there only retail ones are buying.

Similarly, price and volume decrease is when big institution is selling its stock in large amount.
